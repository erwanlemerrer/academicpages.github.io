Hello,
since Nov. 2018, I am on an "advanced research position" at Inria, in the [WIDE team](https://team.inria.fr/wide/team/). My current and main topic of research is the study of [black-box algorithms](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/blackbox-algorithms) in the context of recommender systems, and the attached scalable computation.

I was a senior research scientist at Technicolor R&I (2009-2018), where I worked on scalable storage, processing and machine learning for data analytics and monitoring of home devices. I own a PhD on distributed systems from University of Rennes 1, and a background on peer-to-peer systems, and graph mining/algorithms. My Ph.D. thesis was financed by Orange Labs (where I stayed btw 2004-2007). I obtained my habilitation (HDR) on November 2016 from University of Rennes 1.

### Service

I was co-chair of [Middleware 2018](http://2018.middleware-conference.org/) industry track, in Rennes.

I was in the program committee of the following conferences: MMSYS 2017, HiPC 2016, SSS 2010,2016, PODC's DCC 2016, INFOCOM's DCC 2017, Middleware 2011, ICDCN 2012, INFOCOM's NOM 2014, 2016, 2017, ALGOTEL 2013,2014,2015.

Co-organizing WOS with INRIA, a workshop on storage, cloud processing and data analytics, in every year Rennes; last edition: [WOS8](http://www.bretagne-networking.org/wos8).

I teach big-data storage and processing as a consultant in INSA (Rennes) and Telecom Bretagne (Brest).

I have co-authored [8 granted patents, and 30 pending demands](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=merrer+erwan&oq=inventor:le+merrer+erwan).
