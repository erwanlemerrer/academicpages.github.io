Hello,
I joined Technicolor in 2009, with a PhD on distributed systems (from University of Rennes 1), and a background on peer-to-peer systems, and graph mining/algorithms. I am currently working on machine learning in distributed/cloud environments. I obtained my habilitation (HDR) on November 2016 from University of Rennes 1.

### Service

I was in the program committee of the following conferences: MMSYS 2017, HiPC 2016, SSS 2010,2016, PODC's DCC 2016, INFOCOM's DCC 2017, Middleware 2011, ICDCN 2012, INFOCOM's NOM 2014, 2016, 2017, ALGOTEL 2013,2014,2015.

Co-organizing WOS with INRIA, a workshop on storage, cloud processing and data analytics, in every year Rennes.

I teach big-data storage and processing as a consultant in INSA (Rennes) and Telecom Bretagne (Brest).

I have co-authored 6 patents (granted), and 30 pending.
