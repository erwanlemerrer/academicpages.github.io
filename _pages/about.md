I joined Technicolor in 2009, with a PhD on distributed systems (from University of Rennes 1), and a background on peer-to-peer systems, and graph mining/algorithms.

I am currently working on data-mining and big-data processing in distributed/cloud environments. I obtained my habilitation (HDR) on November 2016 from University of Rennes 1.
